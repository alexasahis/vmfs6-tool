- The project is cloned from Glandium.org. More introduction can be found in https://glandium.org/projects/vmfs-tools/
- Most code is developped by Christophe Fillot <cf (at) utc.fr> and Mike Hommey <mh (at) glandium.org>.
- I cloned the project for the modification of vmfs6 supporting.
- The code in the project is only for vmfs6 for now since the format of vmfs6 changed significantly.
- It is experimental code. Only debugvmfs and vmfsfuse have been applied on a few cases.
